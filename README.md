LeetCode Roadmap
This repository is a personal guide to mastering coding interviews, with a structured roadmap to solving LeetCode problems. It covers essential data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving techniques. Each section is organized by topic, starting from the basics and advancing to more complex concepts, making it suitable for both beginners and experienced coders.

Features
Topic-wise Problem Solving: Problems are categorized by key topics such as Arrays, Linked Lists, Dynamic Programming, Graphs, and more.
Detailed Explanations: For each problem, I provide a solution with an explanation to help understand the approach and logic.
Code Implementations: Solutions are implemented in [Your Preferred Language(s)], showcasing various techniques and optimizations.
Practice Tips: Includes tips and tricks to improve problem-solving speed and efficiency during interviews.
Roadmap
Data Structures: Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, Heaps, Hash Maps
Algorithms: Sorting, Searching, Recursion, Dynamic Programming, Backtracking, Greedy Algorithms, Divide and Conquer
Practice & Review: Regular practice sessions with increasing difficulty levels (Easy → Medium → Hard).
Mock Interviews: Simulating real interview conditions with timed problem-solving sessions.
